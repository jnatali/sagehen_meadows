## data

#### field_observations

field-collected data for four meadows in Sagehen Creek basin, includes:

- groundwater measurement (manual and loggers)
- mapped hydrologic delineations (e.g. springs, channels)
- soil observations at new wells
- phenology descriptions through 2018-2019 growing season. The "raw" data include unprocessed field observations as a starting-point and archive.

#### instrumentation
files in this folder contain geospatial data related to field instruments such as wells, stream gages, weather-related devices

#### phenocam
files in this folder include OUTPUT from phenopix processing.  
files do NOT include the actual phenocam images, the INPUT for phenopix processing.  
For now (will need to be moved by mid-July 2024), the phenocam images (and status sheet) live on Jen's UCB Google Drive in /GoogleDrive/PhD/Manuscripts/2018_ISEECI Sagehen GW Pheno/Analysis/Data/Phenology/phenocam/  
The phenocam images require a large amount of storage.  

#### transects_geophysical
files in this folder contain data related to subsurface geophysical imaging of meadow transects.

#### remote
*(not yet populated)* satellite and aerial imagery of meadows in Sagehen Creek basin
