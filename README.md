#### field_observations

field-collected data for four meadows in Sagehen Creek basin, includes:

- groundwater measurement (manual and loggers)

- soil observations at new wells
- phenology descriptions through 2018-2019 growing season. The "raw" data include unprocessed field observations as a starting-point and archive.
