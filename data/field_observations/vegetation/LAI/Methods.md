- [Manual](https://publications.metergroup.com/Manuals/20442_LP-80_Manual_Web.pdf?_gl=1*1whjm79*_gcl_au*Mjg5ODE4NDM4LjE3NjM1ODg2MzQ.)

## Measurement Dates
Bi-weekly from 07/12/2025 to 11/01/2025

## RAW Downloaded Data
`2025_1113_LAI_RAW.xls` contains 3 sheets:
1. "Summary Data" of LAI and calculation parameters
2. "All Data" includes PAR readings for the 8 sensor segments
3. "Leaf Distribution Estimate" includes the percent cover estimates for vertical, spherical and horizontal leaves within the sample patch for each well. We held this constant through all 2025 readings.

## Estimation of Leaf Distribution Parameter, X
For each well, we estimated the leaf distribution parameter, X, in the field on 07/12/2025. We assumed that vertical leaf canopy had a X=0.9, spherical leaf canopy had X=1.0, and horizontal leaf canopy had X=2.0. Within the 1m x 1m vegetation patch sampling area, we estimated the percent cover of vertical, spherical and horizontal leaf canopy. For willows, we assumed 100% cover of spherical leaf canopy. To calclulate X, we used percent cover to calcluate the weighted sum of vertical, spherical and horizontal leaves.
