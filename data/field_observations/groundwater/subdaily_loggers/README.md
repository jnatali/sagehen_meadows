## Sagehen Groundwater Data: Sub-Daily Loggers in Shallow wells

This directory contains groundwater measurements for three meadows in Sagehen Basin during the growing season: May/June to Oct/Nov 2018-19 using *logging pressure transducers at a 10-min frequency*. 

During this time, the study used:

- six Solinst Levelogger (Model 3001) Pressure Transducers to monitor groundwater level in wells at East and Kiln meadows in 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. 
- one [Solinst Barometer](https://www.solinst.com/products/dataloggers-and-telemetry/3001-levelogger-series/levelogger-edge/datasheet/barometric-compensation.php) to correct for atmospheric pressure effects on all the groundwater leveloggers, usually installed at Kiln during any time period when a pressure transducer was collecting data.

The logger data contained in these folders are organized by year, 2018 and 2019. Each file represents a unique well and time period. The three file types are:

1. .csv with comma separated values, not dependent on any particular software.
2. .xle is only readable by Solinst Levelogger software.
3. .lev is only readable by Solinst Levelogger software.

Because the loggers were moved from well to well, especially during the summer of 2018, please consult [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AUDLyi7_ER2n2P46caTSbKDx0lcRPYqYAcefWkf2Hr0/edit#gid=258617925) for information about the data (well names, start + end times, field notes, logger ID and serial number).  We will track data processing progress in this file.

As we process the data, we'll record tasks and instructions in this [google docs file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SkeEyw_Hy92w4wKUREM5MnydNLWko_dcTGWOw4gq3G8/edit).

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: We don't want to overwrite the original .csv files. If you change the file, please save with a distinct file name. Please use git tools (such as the [github desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/), and see [help docs](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) if needed) to sync files, upload with notes so we can track versions.
