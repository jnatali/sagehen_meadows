C,11/16/24,EFF-XA2S VALIDATE: high reading W23 in 2021,CHANGED in GW_biweekly_RAW; A3S and A2S readings were flipped for that day
C,11/16/24,A3S and A2S first two readings in  2021 seem odd,"CONFIRMED better to change 0606 2021 reading in GW_biweekly_RAW, A2S should have 4.7' readings and A3S should have 3.45' readings"

2,11/16/24,KEF-1 variation seems odd on plots in 2018-2021. Good candidate to test if readings smoother with custom meter offset?,"Try custom meter offset, see if KEF-1 plot improves."
3,11/16/24,"EWT-1 on 06/02/2019: reading looks legitimate (welltop - reading), notes say water at soil surface (but doesn't say PONDED). But reading is >25 cm above surface, could it be under pressure?",assume water is under pressure?

It's still low but not ridiculous."
