## Sagehen Groundwater Data: Sub-Daily Loggers in Shallow wells

This directory contains groundwater levle measurements for three meadows in Sagehen Basin during the growing season: May/June to Oct/Nov 2018-19 using *logging pressure transducers at a 10-min frequency*. 

The logger data contained in these folders are organized by year, 2018 and 2019. Each file represents a unique well and time period. The three file types are:

1. .csv with comma separated values, not dependent on any particular software.
2. .xle is only readable by Solinst Levelogger software.
3. .lev is only readable by Solinst Levelogger software.

Because the loggers were moved from well to well, especially during the summer of 2018, please consult
