# Groundwater Sub-Daily Loggers

## 2018 Groundwater Sub-Daily Loggers Notebook
Running all cells in this notebook will read every csv in the /data folder and cut the data using the rate of change. For each csv file, the script will plot and output how many rows were cut off of each end of the data (useful for validation). Can view plots in notebook and all are saved to plot folder. To run this script on new data, be sure to have the same directory setup.
