### Sources of precipitation and snowpack data

Outside of the field station, there are two other sources of nearby snow data.

1. SNOTEL from NRCS (part of USDA). Should be able to find nearby SNOTEL data from maps linked from here: https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/wcc/home/quicklinks/predefinedMaps/

Nearby SNOTEL stations are:

- Station ID 541, Independence Lake at 8338 ft elevation
- Station ID 539, Independence Camp at 6980 ft elev
- Station ID 540, Independence Creek at 6436 ft elev

2. CA Dept of Water Resources, site at Webber Lake https://cdec.water.ca.gov/dynamicapp/staMeta?station_id=WBB



Whether from Sagehen or these sources, want to analyze snowpack as Snow Water Equivalent (SWE), but to translate from snow depth to SWE weâ€™d need data about the density of the snow.
