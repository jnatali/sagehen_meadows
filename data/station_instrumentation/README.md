## Climate

#### climate_metadata.xlsx

This spreadsheet describes all the climate data collected from Sagehen Basin in terms of variables, instruments and sources.

#### Dendra

Dendra is the online source of Sagehen Field Station climate data (from Tower 1 at East Meadow), located at https://dendra.science/orgs/ucnrs/datastreams?isEnabled=true&stationId=58e68cacdf5ce600012602d1
NOTE: Dendra does not have precipitation data in length scale after 07/14/2020. 

#### DRI / WRCC Western Regional Climate Center

Alternative source of 10-min frequency values for a subset of variables, including complete and corrected data for precipitation (in inches).

Ten-minute data is available (as of 01/21/2026) at: https://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/rawMAIN.pl?nvsagh.
On the lefthand side of the page, click on the link labeled “Data Lister” and you can pull the data for the range you are looking for.
Contact is Allison Krantz, wrcc@dri.edu

NOTE: This data source has precipitation data in length scale after 07/14/2020. 

#### Hobo_temperature

Separate from Dendra, the Sagehen Field Station deployed Hobo loggers in a grid across Sagehen Basin. The loggers record temperature and relative humidity every 10 minutes. Dan Sayler collects this data, shared a Google Drive folder with Jen (she has in an email if we want to expand data set).

We downloaded data for the loggers nearest  our four study meadows: Logger #496 (at Kiln), 137, 125 (downstream of East), and 121. See Figures 1-4 for grid locations at each study meadow.

Coordinates (Northing, Easting) in file ''*all temp plots w-elev.xls*'' are in UTM Zone 10, EPSG:26910.
