## Climate

#### climate_metadata.xlsx

This spreadsheet describes all the climate data collected from Sagehen Basin in terms of variables, instruments and sources.



### Directory Description

#### Dendra

Dendra is the online source of Sagehen Field Station climate data (from Tower 1 at East Meadow), located at https://dendra.science/orgs/ucnrs/datastreams?isEnabled=true&stationId=58e68cacdf5ce600012602d1

#### Hobo_temperature

Separate from Dendra, the Sagehen Field Station deployed Hobo temperature (and relative humidity) loggers in a grid across Sagehen Basin. We downloaded data for the loggers nearest to our four study meadows: Logger #496 (at Kiln), 137, 125 (downstream of East), and 121. See Figures 1-4 for grid locations at each study meadow.

Coordinates (Northing, Easting) in file ''*all temp plots w-elev.xls*'' are in UTM Zone 10, EPSG:26910
