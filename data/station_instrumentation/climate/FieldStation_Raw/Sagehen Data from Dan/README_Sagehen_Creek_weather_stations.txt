Sagehen Creek Reserve Weather Stations
Collin Bode, 2020-12-17, collin@berkeley.edu

This directory contains CSV files from the various monitoring stations at Sagehen Creek.  The older data is from Tower 1, and is not raw data.  It comes from the Western Regional Climate Center, Desert Research Institute (https://wrcc.dri.edu/weather/sagh.html).  Please contact Greg McCurdy, (Greg.McCurdy@dri.edu) or David Simeral (David.Simeral@dri.edu) for source files. All files ending in _dri.dat are downloaded from the WRCC website and are not original.

The Keck Foundation HydroWatch project (~2010-2012) funded the construction of Tower 2-10 and set up LoggerNet on UC Berkeley's Berkeley Natural History Museum server.  All .dat files are original data pulled from the dataloggers and archive on the server.  The Berkeley Sensor Database (http://sensor.berkeley.edu) has some metadata for these files, but not all of them as it was not updated over the years.    

Sagehen was set up on Campbell Scientific's LoggerNet software for pulling data. Around 2016, the rest of the UCNRS reserves were added to the same setup.

Some files were split by water year using a python script.  These files may be found in subdirectories of this folder.  The headers are the same.

At the time of the writing of this readme, the here is the LoggerNet status of the stations at Sagehen:
Station1 (sagh_sagehen): online (JN: this is the data from East meadow!)
Station1_wx100: old CR10X logger disabled since 9/15/2017
Station2_wx: disabled since 10/26/2009 
Station3_wx: online
Station4_wx: online
Station6_wx: disabled since 1/7/2018

Station9_wx: disabled since 6/15/2015

Direct access to LoggerNet possible by request. Please contact Collin.

JN: not sure if other station location data would be useful to us. Need to check if Station 3,4,7,8,11 are near any of our study meadows.
